### Differences between providers

###### AWS

* Theme was making everything easier for customer
* Most popular for strategic, organization-wide adoption

###### Alibaba Cloud

###### Oracle Cloud

Alibaba will probably gain more market share during 2019 as it's revenue doubled on 2018. AWS is remarkably larger than the others and also most used in APAC area so I think it will keep it's position as the top dog in the game. Google's main focus is on AI which takes it's toll on cloud services. IBM and Azure have their own niche customers as long as their service is needed.
